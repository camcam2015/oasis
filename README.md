(hopefully) a public exhibition of someone's life

>...Hence: a Reboot Box. A decent-sized container into which you put your favourite books, your favourite music; the things that spoke to you as a child, as an adult; your diary, your confessions, your desires; your oldest T-shirt and your most-treasured piece of jewellery. Anything that symbolises your identity now, that says, in ways that a straightforward verbal statement of self never could, who you are. Ideally, you'd put places in your Reboot Box, too, but of course they'd never fit inside, so you put a list in, along with a list of smells and times of day, favourite foods and any other things that matter, that mean you and the things you love most profoundly.
